# About Fonil

[Fonil](http://fonil.dev) is a small group of developers who crafts web applications, open-source packages and/or libraries in the PHP ecosystem.

We have craft some products:

- [Dockerized PHP](https://github.com/fonil/dockerized-php): a local development environment for PHP entusiasts.

We use Laravel for most of our projects and love to contribute to Laravel ecosystem. Soon we will publish some Laravel packages we are crafting right now. Stay tunned!
